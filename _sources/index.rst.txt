This is a library to run Anderson extrapolated coordinate descent.

Installation

We recommend to use the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

From a working environment, you can install the package with::

    $ pip install -e .

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

    $ python -c 'import andersoncd'

From a Python shell you can just do::
